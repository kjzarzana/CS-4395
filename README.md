## Assignment 1: Text Processing With Python
Code is located [here](https://github.com/kjzarzana/CS-4395/blob/main/Person_Dict/main.py)

This program takes in employee account information from a csv file and catches any errors that might be found in the formatting of user IDs and phone numbers. The resulting data is then stored in a dictionary and re-displayed cleanly.

This program is run with a filepath as the only argument.
The program assumes data is stored in a file in a comma seperated list.   
For example:   
Last,First,Middle Initial,ID,Office phone  
Smith,Smitty,S,WH1234,5557771212

In this assignment I learned how to search for and reformat data within a file using regex. Python is a powerful tool for text processing because of it's vast libraries and readability.
